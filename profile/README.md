As a software development project manager,
the purpose of structuring project branches is to streamline and organize the development process, making it easier for team members to collaborate and contribute. Here's a common approach that I would consider:

1. **Main Branch**: This is the main branch where the source code always reflects a production-ready state. All releases are pulled from this branch.

2. **Develop Branch**: This branch is a copy of the master branch which integrates different features planned for the next release. This is also known as the integration branch.

3. **Feature Branches**: These branches are used to develop new features for the upcoming or a distant future release. When the feature is complete, it gets merged into the develop branch.

4. **Release Branches**: These branches are created from the develop branch when it's ready for a release. After it's created, no new features can be added — only bug fixes, documentation generation, and other release-oriented tasks should go in here.

5. **Hotfix Branches**: These branches are used to quickly patch production releases. Hotfix branches are a lot like release branches and feature branches except they're based on master instead of develop.

This structure aligns with Agile principles as it allows for continuous integration and encourages frequent commits of small changes, making it easier to track and roll back if necessary.

In terms of distributing new code that may be of interest to all active branches, one approach could be to commit these changes to the develop branch (or create a separate branch for this purpose), then rebase all active feature branches onto develop. This way, all feature branches will have access to the latest changes.

However, this approach has its own challenges such as potential merge conflicts when rebasing. Therefore, it's important to consider the team's Git expertise and the nature of changes when deciding on a branching strategy.

Remember, the goal is to choose a strategy that suits your team's needs and enhances productivity while minimizing conflicts and confusion.
